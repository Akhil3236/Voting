# Full-Stack Assignment: Real-Time Poll Rooms

*Candidate Submission*

---

##  Objective

Build a web application that lets someone create a poll, share it via a link, and collect votes while results update in real-time for all viewers. The goal is to deliver a working product with full-stack capabilities including frontend, backend, database, and real-time communication.

---

##  Required Features (Success Criteria)

### 1. Poll Creation
- A user must be able to create a poll with a question and at least 2 options.
- After creation, the app must generate a shareable link to that poll.
- **Implementation**: Host authentication using JWT, poll creation API endpoint, MongoDB persistence.

### 2. Join by Link
- Anyone with the share link must be able to view the poll and vote on one option (single-choice).
- **Implementation**: Public poll viewing route `/poll/[id]`, no authentication required for voters.

### 3. Real-Time Results
- When any user votes, all other users viewing that poll must see results update without manually refreshing the page.
- **Implementation**: Socket.io WebSocket integration with event-based broadcasting.

### 4. Fairness / Anti-Abuse
The app must include **at least two mechanisms** that reduce repeat/abusive voting:

**Implemented Mechanisms:**

1. **Device Fingerprinting (localStorage VoterID)**
   - Every voter is assigned a unique `voterId` stored in browser's `localStorage`
   - Prevents: Multiple votes from same browser/tab by refreshing
   - Limitation: Can be bypassed by clearing localStorage or using incognito mode

2. **Device-Based Tracking (Removed IP Restriction)**
   - ~~IP Address Tracking~~ (Removed due to false positives on shared networks)
   - Now relies solely on device-specific `voterId` for fairness
   - Prevents: Same device voting multiple times
   - Allows: Multiple people on same WiFi network to vote separately

**Known Limitations:**
- Users can bypass by clearing browser storage
- VPN usage allows multiple votes from different "devices"
- Trade-off made to allow legitimate multiple users on same network

### 5. Persistence
- Polls and votes must be persisted so that refreshing the page does not lose the poll or votes.
- The share link must still work later (not only for the current session).
- **Implementation**: MongoDB database with Mongoose ODM.

### 6. Deployment
- ~~Share a publicly accessible URL where the app can be used.~~
- **Status**: Application runs locally. Instructions provided for deployment.
- **Live Demo**: `https://vote.trackur.org`

##  Implementation Details

### Database Schema

**Poll Model:**
```javascript
{
  question: String,
  options: [
    {
      text: String,
      votes: { type: Number, default: 0 }
    }
  ],
  voters: [
    {
      ip: String,
      deviceId: String
    }
  ],
  host: { type: ObjectId, ref: "Host" },
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
}
```

**Host Model:**
```javascript
{
  username: String,
  email: { type: String, unique: true },
  password: String (hashed with bcrypt)
}
```

### API Endpoints

**Public Routes:**
- `GET /api/public/poll/:id` - Get poll details
- `POST /api/public/poll/:id/vote` - Submit a vote

**Protected Routes (JWT Required):**
- `POST /api/poll/create` - Create new poll
- `GET /api/poll/all` - Get all polls by host
- `PUT /api/poll/edit/:id` - Edit poll
- `DELETE /api/poll/delete/:id` - Delete poll

**Authentication:**
- `POST /api/host/signup` - Register new host
- `POST /api/host/login` - Login and get JWT token

### Real-Time Flow

1. **Vote Submission**:
   - Client sends vote via POST request
   - Backend validates and updates database
   - Backend emits Socket.io event: `pollUpdate:${pollId}`
   - All connected clients listening to that event receive updated poll data

2. **Socket.io Events**:
```javascript
// Backend emits
socket.emit(`pollUpdate:${pollId}`, updatedPoll);

// Frontend listens
socket.on(`pollUpdate:${pollId}`, (data) => {
  setPoll(data);
});
```

## 👨‍💻 Developer Notes

### Why Device-Only Tracking?
Initially implemented both IP and device tracking. However, IP-based blocking caused issues where multiple legitimate users on the same network (e.g., family, office, school) were prevented from voting. The decision was made to prioritize user experience over strict controls, as the device fingerprinting provides sufficient protection for most use cases.

### Socket.io + HTTP Response
The application uses a hybrid approach:
- Vote endpoint returns updated poll data in HTTP response
- Backend also emits Socket.io event with same data
- Frontend updates from HTTP response immediately
- Socket.io provides redundancy and powers real-time updates for other viewers

This ensures UI updates even if Socket.io connection fails temporarily.
